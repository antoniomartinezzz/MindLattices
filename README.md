# Mind Lattice: A New Parcellation Technique for Brain Graphs Construction

Current brain graph construction methods for functional connectivity studies involve using a priori atlases to partition the brain into regions of interest. These methods often result in information loss and fail to capture functional variability across individuals. To address these limitations, we propose to partition the brain into overlapping regions for each individual subject, using a three-dimensional sliding window. To evaluate the performance of our parcellation technique, we train and evaluate **BrainGNN** and **Brain Network Transformer** (BNT) on a classification task using the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) I dataset and compare the modelâ€™s performance with two commonly used a-priori ROI atlases, Craddock 200 (**CC200**) and Harvard-Oxford (**HO**). The results suggest that our parcellation strategy achieves comparable performance compared to conventional methods. The models present unstable performance due to noise in the dataset which makes experimentation and optimization difficult. Performance variability across dataset distributions does not allow for a fair comparison across parcellation strategies and across studies. We highlight the need of a well defined benchmark to facilitate the study of this problem. 


We evaluate and compare the utility of the baseline parcellation strategies (CC200 and HO) with our parcellation strategy using BrainGNN and BNT on the ABIDE I dataset, using a 5-fold cross-validation with five repetitions.

## BrainGNN
See the BrainGNN.yaml for environment configuration.
### Installation
Clone the repository 

Run these lines to create and activate an appropriate 
environment:

```conda create --name yourEnv python=3.8```

```conda activate yourEnv```

```pip install nilearn```

```pip install deepdish```

```pip install tensorboardX==2.2```

```pip install protobuf==3.17.0```

```pip install torch-geometric==1.7.0```

```conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 torchaudio==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch```

```pip3 install torch-sparse==0.6.9 --no-cache-dir -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.7.0+cu110.html```

```pip3 install torch-scatter==2.0.6 --no-cache-dir -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.7.0+cu110.html```

```pip install networkx==2.5```

```pip install numpy==1.23.4```

### Test

To test the pretrained BrainGNN model using the 5-fold cross-validation with five repetitions using the proposed parcellation method, run:

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode test```

This will test the models and print the mean ACC, AUC-ROC and AUC.

To test using the baseline parcellations, use the --parcellation argument with either CC200 or HO. For example, for CC200:

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode test --parcellation CC200```


### Train-test

To train a new set of models to replicate our results, run: 

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode train```

This will train and test five repetition of a 5-fold cross-validation. Keep in mind that the results vary accross runs, so metrics will slightly vary to those reported in the paper. 

Similarly to the test, you can choose the parcellation.

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode train --parcellation CC200```

Finally, you can choose how many repetitions to train and test, using the --repetitions arguments. For example, to train using only one repetition instead of five, run:

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode train --parcellation OURS --repetitions 1```


### Demo

Run 

```python main_BrainGNN.py --mode demo```  to choose a random subject and predict wether they are autistic or not. 


## BNT

### Installation

```conda create --name BNT python=3.9```

```conda activate BNT```

```pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113```

```conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn```

```conda install -c conda-forge pandas```

```pip install omegaconf```

``` pip install tqdm```




To test, train-test and demo on BNT, follow the same instructions than for BrainGNN, changing the file to main_BNT.py
### Test

### Train-test

```python main_BNT.py --mode train```

### Demo

```python main_BNT.py --mode demo```
